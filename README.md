  ## **Installation**
  To download the source code for this app, clone the [Portfolio GitHub repo](https://github.com/DonnaThompson7/DThompson-Portfolio), then run `npm install`. This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory (if one doesnt exist yet) and will download the package to that directory. You can check to see if you already have node.js installed by running either the npm -v or the npm version command. Note:If there is no package.jsonfile in the local directory, the latest version of the package is installed. To start the app, run `npm start`.
